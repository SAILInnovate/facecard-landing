            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
              Based in Los Angeles, Alonzo Avera founded Facecard in 2025 with a clear mission: to dismantle the financial barriers that stifle creativity. As a public speaker and entrepreneur with a history of success, he knows firsthand the immense challenges of accessing capital.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
              His journey began when he tried to secure a business loan for his record label, <strong>4mBrothers</strong>. The process was nearly impossible. As a creative, he found himself lost in the complex world of business structures and financeâ€”a world where essential information on credit was gatekept and hard to come by.
            </p>
            {/* --- THIS PARAGRAPH HAS BEEN CORRECTED --- */}
            <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
              Through sheer persistence, Alonzo successfully obtained his initial investment using credit banking. This hard-won victory inspired him to create Facecard: a US-based fast track to funding, designed to save creators time and empower them to focus on **his or her** art, craft, and business models.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-400 text-sm italic">
                Note: Facecard is a US-based entity and operates separately from international partners like Praedexa.
